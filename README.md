<p>The DP_Cookies script creates a global object which provides the developer with simple, abstracted client-side management of browser cookies.</p>
<ul><li>The script supports the original <a href="http://wp.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html">cookie specification</a> which is in common use.</li>
	<li>The object provides methods to get, set and erase (delete) cookies by name.</li>
	<li>The object provides methods to erase or return (as a JavaScript object) all available cookies as a set.</li>
</ul>
<p>The extension is self-contained and presents an extremely small footprint.  Only a single global object, "DP_Cookies", is created.</p>
<p>This component requires a JavaScript (ECMAScript) 1.3 (or better) development environment and has been tested successfully on Internet Explorer 6+, Firefox 1+ and Opera 9+.</p>
